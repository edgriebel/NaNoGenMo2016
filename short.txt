Using Scanners, you will end up spawning a lot of objects for every line. You will generate a decent amount of garbage for the GC with large files. Also, it is nearly three times slower than using split().

On the other hand, If you split by space (line.split(" ")), the code will fail if you try to read a file with a different whitespace delimiter. If split() expects you to write a regular expression, and it does matching anyway, use split("\\s") instead, that matches a "bit" more whitespace than just a space character.

P.S.: Sorry, I don't have right to comment on already given answers.
