# About
- N-gram https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram
- Markov Chain

# Next
- implement 3-gram to get better sentences
- better determination of proper nouns

# Bugs
- sometimes period appears after other punctuation

# Ideas:
- html: hover display words that could have been chosen and probs
- generate PDF file programmatically
- variable-length sentences (would require bayesian-type methods?)
