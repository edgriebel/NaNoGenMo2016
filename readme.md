# About
- N-gram https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram
- Markov Chain

# Next
- move docs to separate directory
- Reader reads from internet
- rename "Test"
- Create main() that implements testGenerate()
- have First.store() return freqs
- implement 3-gram to get better sentences
- better determination of proper nouns

# Bugs
- sometimes period appears after other punctuation
  - Create unit test demonstrating it

# Ideas:
- html: hover display words that could have been chosen and probs
- generate PDF file programmatically
- variable-length sentences (would require bayesian-type methods?)
