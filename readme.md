# About
- N-gram https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram
- Markov Chain

# Next
- [x] move docs to separate directory 
- [ ] Reader reads from internet
- [x] rename "First" to MarkovBigram
- [ ] Create main() that implements testGenerate()
- [ ] have First.store() return freqs object instad of requiring it to be passed in
- [ ] implement 3-gram to get better sentences
- [ ] better determination of proper nouns
- [ ] More unit tests

# Bugs
- [ ] sometimes period appears after other punctuation
  - [ ] Create unit test demonstrating it

# Ideas:
- html: hover display words that could have been chosen and probs
- generate PDF file programmatically
- variable-length sentences (would require bayesian-type methods?)
