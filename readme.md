# Next
- [ ] Reader reads from Internet
- [ ] Create `main()` that implements calls in `testGenerate()`
- [ ] have `store()` return `freqs` object instead of requiring it to be passed in
- [ ] implement 3-gram to get better sentences
- [ ] More unit tests
- [ ] find lib to do word-wrap
- [x] better determination of proper nouns
- [x] move docs to separate directory 
- [x] rename "First" to MarkovBigram

# Bugs
- [ ] sometimes period appears after other punctuation
  - [ ] Create unit test demonstrating it

# Ideas:
- html: hover display words that could have been chosen and probs
- generate PDF file programmatically
- variable-length sentences (would require bayesian-type methods?)
